# Replace the placeholder values with your actual Upstox API credentials.
# You can get these from the Upstox developer console: https://account.upstox.com/developer/apps

UPSTOX_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
UPSTOX_API_SECRET="YOUR_API_SECRET"

# To get your access token:
# 1. Run the application (gunicorn app:app).
# 2. Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser. It will show an error initially.
# 3. You need to generate a login link. You can do this by adding a temporary print statement
#    in the `initialize_api_client` function in `app.py` to print the login URL.
#    Example:
#    # from upstox_client.api import login_api
#    # login = login_api.LoginApi(api_client)
#    # login_url_response = login.authorise("YOUR_API_KEY", "http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback", "v1")
#    # print(f"Login URL: {login_url_response.data.url}")
# 4. Visit the generated URL, log in, and you will be redirected to the callback URL.
# 5. The auth code will be in the URL. Copy it.
# 6. Use a separate script or tool (like Postman) to exchange the auth code for an access token.
# 7. Paste the obtained access token below.
UPSTOX_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"

# The redirect URI must match the one configured in your Upstox app.
UPSTOX_REDIRECT_URI="http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback"
